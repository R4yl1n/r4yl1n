# 💫 About Me

---

### 🛠️ I’m currently working on

A modular monitoring stack focused on reliable server and network observability.  
My current work includes C++ network tooling, DevOps automation, and continuous improvement of my own infrastructure environment.

---

### 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on

Projects that combine network engineering, automation, and clean architectural design.  
If it involves scripting, playbooks, pipelines, or system-level development, I’m interested.

---

### 🌱 I’m currently learning

Modern C++ with a focus on system and network programming.  
Additionally improving my skills in data engineering, Ansible workflows, and business informatics to build solutions that are both technically solid and practically relevant.

---

### 💬 Ask me about

Homelabs, networking, VPNs, firewalls, Docker deployments, monitoring stacks, Proxmox, ZFS, Ansible, C++, SQL, and ETL pipelines — or general troubleshooting logic.

---

### ⚡ Fun fact

I frequently redesign and optimize my own infrastructure — not because it’s broken, but because I want to understand how to make it even better.
